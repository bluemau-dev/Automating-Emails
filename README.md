# Introduction
Hello, my name is Mauricio. A lot of people call me 'Mau' for short. Hence my developer name Bluemau.dev

# Subject
This will be the first project that I will proceed to do with my new GitHub account. For this account, my goal is to get to the end of each project I will work on.

# About
This project is to understand and learn more about Python's Built In Modules and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Library.

I'd like to be able to send myself emails periodically throughout the week, sort of like notifications that can: motivate me, make me laugh, etc.

# Resources
I've had problems with programming recently. Relying too much on AI, not understanding core concepts, and losing the ambition. That is why I am using resources like 'No Start Press Automating the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart', which will guide me on this journey. I will also be using online resources like Stack Overflow and Reddit Communities to find answers and understandings to questions that I need help on. ()()()()
